				<h2>The Maxsus Difference</h2>
				<p>Georgia native Luke Hendon started Maxsus in 2008 from the dream of one and has grown to help the lives of many.</p>
				<p>Not having much money back then for an official office location, Luke would gather with his work crew in the morning at a Whole Foods where he would host a daily production meeting and buy everybody coffee &amp; breakfast to get the day started. Within a few months he earned enough to move the crew into the first location and get a few work trucks. A couple of years later, Maxsus is providing roofing &amp; restoration services across several cities throughout the southeast.</p>
				<p>Luke attributes much of his success to an unparalleled standard of quality. Ensuring each home owner is delighted with their their results has certainly paid off: from these humble beginnings Luke has expanded Maxsus to help restore thousands of Georgia homes without losing remarkable quality service that made Maxsus stand out.</p>

					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p>If a storm has damaged your roof, homeowner's insurance may replace them at no cost to you! You'll definitely have questions, and we will be here to walk you through each step of the process.</p>

					<i class="line-font blue icon-question"></i>
					<h4>Does my insurance provider cover the total repair/replacement?</h4>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>In most severe storm damage situations, we find that all insurance providers (depending on your individual policy) will cover the total cost of roofing &amp; restoration repairs and replacements, with the exception of your deductible.</p>
						<p>This is a preventative measure that insurance agencies gladly take to ensure any damage to your homes exterior does not lead to further leak related damage to the homes interior and its content (your costly possessions) that could potentially end up costing them thousands more in damaged property claims if the issues are not quickly addressed.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-body">
					<i class="line-font blue icon-question"></i>
					<h4>Can Maxsus Inc. cover the cost of my deductible?</h4>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>As a certified and reputable contractor, Maxsus Inc. can in NO situation offer to cover the cost of any insurance deductibles as doing so is a violation of most state laws. However, we do offer special Deals &amp; Savings Programs that may help a homeowner reduce or recoup the burden of any out of pocket expenses. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
				<div class="faq-body">
					<i class="line-font blue icon-question"></i>
					<h4>What if something is left out in the claim that we find during construction?</h4>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>In order for Maxsus Inc. to ensure we provide you with the best products and craftsmanship possible, it is crucial your carrier covers the claim in full. For example, there are over 30 steps in the re-roofing process. Failure to cover one of these steps results in an inferior roofing/siding system.</p>
						<p>Most items missed by the insurance carrier are simple oversights. We can at any time provide them with pictures, diagrams, estimates, and other project files that are stored in Acculynx and backed up on our servers so the claim process continues without interruption.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-body">
					<i class="line-font blue icon-question"></i>
					<h4>What happens with any left over materials?</h4>
					<div class="answer">
						<p>In most cases we will supply each project with extra materials beyond the scope of work to ensure that when a project is running short on materials at the end of the day when all the supply distributors have closed, our crews will have enough material to complete the job without having to leave a roof incomplete for any period of time. Once your job is complete, our field supervisor will run a final inspection and make sure all excess and leftover materials are picked up and properly returned.</p>
